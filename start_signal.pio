; SET pin is mapped to GPIO 0

; Running at 125MHz so each instruction cycle is 8ns.
; We set the start signal high for 160ns (20 cycles).
; Then set it low for 160ns (20 cycles).
; Then wait until we are told to set it again.

    set pins, 1 [19]    ; set high, 1 cycle, then delay an additional 19 cycles
